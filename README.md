SpatialGPT: Conversational Geospatial Weather Intelligence
🔥 Core Idea
An AI-powered assistant that helps users explore and understand weather patterns, forecasts, and climate trends for any location on Earth—through natural language and map-based interaction, powered by the Open-Meteo API and geolocation data.

🎯 Key Use Cases

1. Localized Weather Q&A
   Natural language prompts like:

“What’s the weather in Tokyo this weekend?”

“Will it snow in Berlin tomorrow?”

“How hot will it get in Phoenix next week?”

Supports current weather, 7–14 day forecasts, and hourly details (wind, temp, humidity).

2. Weather Trends & Historical Insight
   Ask about historical weather trends using Open-Meteo’s archive support:

“How has rainfall changed in Mumbai over the past 5 years?”

“What were the average temperatures in London last summer?”

Visualize trends using charts/graphs tied to maps.

3. Climate-Aware Travel & Planning
   Assist users in choosing destinations or planning trips based on climate:

“Where is it sunny and warm in Europe right now?”

“I want to hike in a cool place with no rain this week—any suggestions?”

Combine Open-Meteo forecasts with hiking trails, points of interest via OpenStreetMap.

4. Extreme Weather Alerts
   Real-time monitoring and alerts:

“Are there any heatwaves or storms nearby?”

“Warn me if a strong wind alert is issued within 50 km.”

Could use natural hazard feeds or augment Open-Meteo’s wind/gust thresholds.

5. Environmental Learning
   Ask climate and weather-related science questions contextualized to location:

“Why is it so windy in the Netherlands?”

“What’s a rain shadow and where can I see one?”

“What kind of climate does Nairobi have?”
